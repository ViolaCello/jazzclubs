* Database creation
This appication uses the postresql database in Rails.  To initialize, on my system, anyway, it need to type:
sudo service postgresql restart
then,
rails db:create

Once you get it forked and cloned onto your system, it should begin to run once you 
rails s

and then open the index.html file from the frontend using the Chrome Browser.
